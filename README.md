# Pretext

Pure JavaScript/TypeScript library for multiline text measurement & layout. Fast, accurate & supports all the languages you didn't even know about. Allows rendering to DOM, Canvas, SVG and soon, server-side.

Pretext side-steps the need for DOM measurements (e.g. `getBoundingClientRect`, `offsetHeight`), which trigger layout reflow, one of the most expensive operations in the browser. It implements its own text measurement logic, using the browsers' own font engine as ground truth (very AI-friendly iteration method).

## Installation

Still private for now. Clone the repo and run `bun install`.

## API

Pretext serves 2 use cases:

### 1. Measure a paragraph's height _without ever touching DOM_

```ts
import { prepare, layout } from './src/layout.ts'

const prepared = prepare('AGI 春天到了. بدأت الرحلة 🚀', '16px Inter')
const { height, lineCount } = layout(prepared, textWidth, 20) // pure arithmetics. No DOM layout & reflow!
```

`prepare()` does the one-time work: normalize whitespace, segment the text, apply glue rules, measure the segments with canvas, and return an opaque handle. `layout()` is the cheap hot path after that: pure arithmetic over cached widths.

On the current local benchmark snapshot:
- `prepare()` is about `17ms` for the shared 500-text batch
- `layout()` is about `0.10ms` for that same batch

We support all the languages you can imagine, including emojis and mixed-bidi, and caters to specific browser quirks

The returned height is the crucial last piece for unlocking web UI's:
- proper virtualization/occlusion without guesstimates & caching
- fancy userland layouts: masonry, JS-driven flexbox-like implementations, nudging a few layout values without CSS hacks (imagine that), etc.
- _development time_ verification (especially now with AI) that labels on e.g. buttons don't overflow to the next line, browser-free
- prevent layout shift when new text loads and you wanna re-anchor the scroll position

### 2. Lay out the paragraph lines manually yourself

```ts
import {
  prepareWithSegments,
  layoutNextLine,
} from './src/layout.ts'

const prepared = prepareWithSegments('AGI 春天到了. بدأت الرحلة 🚀', '18px "Helvetica Neue"')
let cursor = { segmentIndex: 0, graphemeIndex: 0 }
let y = 0

for (const rowWidth of [320, 320, 260, 240, 320, 320]) {
  const line = layoutNextLine(prepared, cursor, rowWidth)
  if (line === null) break
  drawText(line.text, 40, y)
  cursor = line.end
  y += 26
}
```

This usage allows:
- even fancier layout possibilities. See the [Dynamic Layout](/pages/dynamic-layout.html) demo.
- rendering to canvas, SVG, WebGL and (eventually) server-side

This is the richer path:
- `layout()` gives you the height of a fixed-width paragraph
- `layoutNextLine()` lets you route text one row at a time when width changes as you go
- `walkLineRanges()` is the fixed-width low-level geometry helper when you want ranges and widths without building strings

That second case is how the richer demos work. See [/dynamic-layout.html](/dynamic-layout.html).

### API Glossary

Use-case 1 APIs:
```ts
prepare(text: string, font: string): PreparedText // one-time text analysis pass, returns an opaque value to pass to `layout()`. Make sure `font` is synced with your css `font` declaration shorthand (e.g. size, weight, style, family) for the text you're measuring. `font` is the same format as what you'd use for `myCanvasContext.font = ...`, e.g. `16px Inter`.
layout(prepared: PreparedText, maxWidth: number, lineHeight: number): { height: number, lineCount: number } // calculates text height given a max width and lineHeight. Make sure `lineHeight` is synced with your css `line-height` declaration for the text you're measuring.
```

Use-case 2 APIs:
```ts
prepareWithSegments(text: string, font: string): PreparedTextWithSegments // same as `prepare()`, but returns a richer structure for manual line layouts needs
layoutWithLines(prepared: PreparedTextWithSegments, maxWidth: number, lineHeight: number): { height: number, lineCount: number, lines: LayoutLine[] } // high-level api for manual layout needs. Accepts a fixed max width for all lines. Similar to `layout()`'s return, but additionally returns the lines info
walkLineRanges(prepared: PreparedTextWithSegments, maxWidth: number, onLine: (line: LayoutLineRange) => void): number // low-level api for manual layout needs. Accepts a fixed max width for all lines. Calls `onLine` once per line with its actual calculated line width and start/end cursors, without building line text strings. Very useful for certain cases where you wanna speculatively test a few width and height boundaries (e.g. binary search a nice width value by repeatedly calling walkLineRanges and checking the line count, and therefore height, is "nice" too. You can have text messages shrinkwrap and balanced text layout this way). After walkLineRanges calls, you'd call layoutWithLines once, with your satisfying max width, to get the actual lines info.
layoutNextLine(prepared: PreparedTextWithSegments, cursor: LayoutCursor, width: number): LayoutLine | null // iterator-like api for layout each line with a different width! Returns the next LayoutLine, or `null` when the paragraph's exhausted
type LayoutLine = {
  text: string // Full text content of this line, e.g. 'hello world'
  width: number // Measured width of this line, e.g. 87.5
  start: LayoutCursor // Inclusive start cursor in prepared segments/graphemes
  end: LayoutCursor // Exclusive end cursor in prepared segments/graphemes
  trailingDiscretionaryHyphen: boolean // True when a visible trailing hyphen was inserted from a soft hyphen break
}
type LayoutLineRange = {
  width: number // Measured width of this line, e.g. 87.5
  start: LayoutCursor // Inclusive start cursor in prepared segments/graphemes
  end: LayoutCursor // Exclusive end cursor in prepared segments/graphemes
  trailingDiscretionaryHyphen: boolean // True when a visible trailing hyphen was inserted from a soft hyphen break
}
type LayoutCursor = {
  segmentIndex: number // Segment index in on prepareWithSegments' prepared rich segment stream
  graphemeIndex: number // Grapheme index within that segment; `0` at segment boundaries
}
```

Other helpers:
```ts
clearCache(): void // clears Pretext's shared internal caches used by prepare() and prepareWithSegments(). Useful if your app cycles through many different fonts or text variants and you want to release the accumulated cache
setLocale(locale?: string): void // optional (byu default we use the current locale). Sets locale for future prepare() and prepareWithSegments(). Internally, it also calls clearCache(). Setting a new locale doesn't affect existing prepare() and prepareWithSegments() states (no mutations to them)
```

## Caveats

Pretext doesn't try to be a full font rendering engine (yet?). It currently targets the common text setup:
- `white-space: normal`
- `word-break: normal`
- `overflow-wrap: break-word`
- `system-ui` is unsafe for `layout()` accuracy on macOS. Use a named font
- Because the default target includes `overflow-wrap: break-word`, very narrow widths can still break inside words, but only at grapheme boundaries.
